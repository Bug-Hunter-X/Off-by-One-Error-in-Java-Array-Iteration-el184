This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration.  The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds.  The `bugSolution.java` file shows the corrected code with the loop condition adjusted to avoid the error.  This example highlights the importance of careful array indexing to prevent runtime exceptions.
